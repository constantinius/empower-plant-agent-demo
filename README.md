## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- OpenAI API key
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd empower-plant-agent-demo
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your OpenAI API key and other settings
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Agents Overview

The system includes two specialized AI agents, each with their own set of tools and capabilities:

### 🌱 Plant Care Agent (`/api/v1/chat/plant`)

**Purpose**: Provides expert advice on plant health, care, and troubleshooting

**Tools Available**:

- **get-plant-care-guide** (MCP): Retrieves comprehensive plant care guides from the MCP server
- **calculate_watering_schedule** (Local Function): Calculates personalized watering schedules based on plant type, pot size, season, and location

**Smart Handoffs**: Automatically transfers to Shopping Agent when users ask about purchasing products, tools, or want to buy something

**Example Usage**:

```bash
# Get personalized watering advice
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/chat/plant" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "How often should I water my succulent in winter?",
    "context": {
      "plant_type": "succulent",
      "pot_size": "small",
      "season": "winter"
    }
  }'

# The agent will automatically use the watering calculator to provide:
# - Specific watering frequency (e.g., "every 7 days")
# - Seasonal adjustments for winter care
# - Pot size considerations
# - Plant-specific tips for succulents
```

### 🛒 Shopping Agent (`/api/v1/chat/shopping`)

**Purpose**: Helps users find products and complete purchases

**Tools Available**:

- **get-products** (MCP): Retrieves available products based on search criteria
- **checkout** (MCP): Processes orders and handles the checkout flow

**Smart Handoffs**: Automatically transfers to Plant Care Agent when users ask about plant care, gardening advice, plant health issues, or how to care for plants

**Example Usage**:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/chat/shopping" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "I need gardening tools for beginners",
    "context": {
      "budget": "50",
      "experience": "beginner"
    }
  }'
```

## Smart Agent Handoffs

The multi-agent system features intelligent handoffs that automatically transfer conversations between agents when specialized expertise is needed.

### How Handoffs Work

1. **Automatic Detection**: Each agent monitors the conversation for topics outside their expertise
2. **Seamless Transfer**: When a handoff is needed, the agent automatically transfers the conversation
3. **Context Preservation**: The receiving agent gets full context of the previous conversation
4. **Transparent Process**: Users experience a smooth transition without interruption

### Handoff Scenarios

#### Plant Agent → Shopping Agent

The Plant Care Agent will transfer to the Shopping Agent when users:

- Ask about purchasing gardening tools or supplies
- Want to buy fertilizers, pots, or plant accessories
- Need product recommendations for plant care
- Express interest in making a purchase

**Example**:

```
User: "My plant needs better drainage. What should I buy?"
Plant Agent: "For better drainage, you'll need... Let me transfer you to our shopping expert who can help you find the right products."
→ Transfers to Shopping Agent
```

#### Shopping Agent → Plant Agent

The Shopping Agent will transfer to the Plant Care Agent when users:

- Ask about plant care, health, or troubleshooting
- Need gardening advice or growing tips
- Have questions about plant identification
- Want help with plant problems

**Example**:

```
User: "I bought this fertilizer, but my plant's leaves are still yellow. What's wrong?"
Shopping Agent: "It sounds like there might be other factors affecting your plant's health. Let me connect you with our plant care expert."
→ Transfers to Plant Care Agent
```

### Benefits

- **Specialized Expertise**: Each agent focuses on what they do best
- **Better User Experience**: Users get the most relevant help without switching manually
- **Comprehensive Support**: Complete coverage from advice to purchase to ongoing care
- **Natural Conversation Flow**: Handoffs feel like talking to a knowledgeable team

### Docker Deployment

1. **Build and run with docker-compose**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. **Or build and run manually**
   ```bash
   docker build -t plant-agent .
   docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env plant-agent
   ```

## Observability with Sentry

The application includes comprehensive observability through Sentry integration:

### Features

- **Error Tracking**: Automatic capture of exceptions and errors
- **Performance Monitoring**: Transaction tracing for API requests and agent processing
- **Custom Context**: Plant query context and metadata for better debugging
- **Breadcrumbs**: Detailed execution flow tracking
- **Release Tracking**: Version-based error tracking and deployment monitoring

### Setup

1. **Create a Sentry account** at [sentry.io](https://sentry.io)

2. **Create a new project** for your Python/FastAPI application

   SENTRY_PROFILES_SAMPLE_RATE=1.0  # 100% profiling (adjust for production)
   ```

5. **For production**, consider reducing sample rates:
   ```bash
   SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE=0.1  # 10% of transactions
   SENTRY_PROFILES_SAMPLE_RATE=0.1  # 10% profiling
   ```

### Monitoring Features

## Development

### Development Setup

For the best development experience with automatic import sorting and code formatting:

1. **Install development dependencies**:

   ```bash
   make dev-setup
   ```

2. **VS Code users**: The project includes VS Code settings for automatic import sorting and formatting on save.

3. **Manual formatting**:
   ```bash
   make format      # Format code with black and sort imports
   make lint        # Run linting checks
   make sort-imports # Sort imports only
   ```

### Running Tests

```bash
pytest
# or
make test
```

### Code Quality Tools

The project uses several tools to maintain code quality:

- **isort**: Automatic import sorting (configured to work with black)
- **black**: Code formatting
- **flake8**: Linting
- **mypy**: Type checking
- **pre-commit**: Git hooks for automatic code quality checks

### Available Make Commands

```bash
make install      # Install dependencies
make dev-setup    # Set up development environment
make format       # Format code and sort imports
make lint         # Run all linting checks
make test         # Run tests
make run          # Run the application
make docker-run   # Run with Docker
make clean        # Clean up generated files
```

### Adding New Agents

1. Create a new agent module using `openai_agents.Agent` directly as a module variable:

   ```python
   # app/agents/my_agent.py
   from openai_agents import Agent, Runner

   # Create agent as module variable
   my_agent = Agent(
       name="MyAgent",
       instructions="You are a helpful assistant specialized in...",
       model="gpt-4"
   )

   async def process_message(message: str) -> str:
       result = await Runner.run(my_agent, message)
       return result.final_output
   ```

2. Import and use in `app/api/routes.py`:

   ```python
   from app.agents.my_agent import my_agent, process_message
   ```

3. Update the main application to include new endpoints

## API Documentation

Once the application is running, visit:
